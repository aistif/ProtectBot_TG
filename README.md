## Last Note

```python-telegram-bot``` library is poor in community engagement and explainability of features in its documentation. There are other libraries like ``telebot`` which is widely used and the community loves it if you want to build more complex bot [TeleBot Doc](https://telepot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
